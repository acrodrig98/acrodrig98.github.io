# About Me
I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Astronomy Department](https://www.astro.caltech.edu) at Caltech working with [Shri Kulkarni](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/), [Kareem El-Badry](https://kareemelbadry.github.io/), and [Tom Prince](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~prince/). I'm also fortunate to be an [NSF Graduate Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellow](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ford-foundation-fellowships).

I work on discovering and characterizing accreting binary stars: from the [highly magnetic](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...945..141R/abstract) to the [ultracompact](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...954...63R/abstract), and even on [stellar mass black holes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05685.pdf). My work primarily relies on a multiwavelength crossmatch between X-rays from the [SRG/eROSITA mission](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA) and optical data from the [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu) and [Gaia](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia_overview), though I also use data from other [X-ray](https://chandra.harvard.edu/), [optical](https://www.keckobservatory.org/), and [radio](https://www.vla.nrao.edu/) telescopes. 

I'm originally from the town (small city) of Salinas, California and then completed my undergraduate education in the [Physics Department](https://physics.stanford.edu) at Stanford.
