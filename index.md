# About Me
I am a first-year graduate student in the [Astronomy Department](https://www.astro.caltech.edu) at Caltech. I'm originally from the town (small city) of Salinas, California -- be sure to check out the [Salinas Observatory](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Community/Salinas-Observatory-103836256351138/) if you're in the area! I then completed my undergraduate education in the [Physics Department](https://physics.stanford.edu) at Stanford, where I participated in a number of student groups and ensembles, most notably the [Stanford Astronomical Society](https://orion.stanford.edu). In the past, I have conducted research in high-energy astrophysics, cosmology, and the astrophysics of young stars.
