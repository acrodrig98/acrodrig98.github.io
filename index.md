# About Me
I am an astrophysicist working on understanding the extreme physics of binary stars. I apply data mining techniques, both classical and artificial intelligence (AI)-based, to make discoveries in the the largest astronomical datasets ever made.  

I earned my PhD in the [Astronomy Department](https://www.astro.caltech.edu) at Caltech working with Professors [Shri Kulkarni](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/), [Kareem El-Badry](https://kareemelbadry.github.io/), and [Tom Prince](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~prince/). I was fortunate to be an [NSF Graduate Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellow](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ford-foundation-fellowships), and [LSST-DA Data Science Fellow](https://lsstdiscoveryalliance.org/programs/data-science-fellowship/).

My work primarily relies on a multiwavelength crossmatch between X-rays from the [SRG/eROSITA mission](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA) and optical data from the [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu) and [Gaia](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia_overview), though I also use data from other [X-ray](https://chandra.harvard.edu/), [optical](https://www.keckobservatory.org/), and [radio](https://www.vla.nrao.edu/) telescopes. I am broadly interested in applying statistical techniques to extract scientific results out of large astronomical datasets, and have shown that [a simple tool, the "X-ray Main Sequence",](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024PASP..136e4201R/abstract) can efficiently reveal the true [demographics of accreting white dwarfs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240816053R/abstract) in the solar neighborhood.

I'm originally from the town (small city) of Salinas, California and then completed my undergraduate education in the [Physics Department](https://physics.stanford.edu) at Stanford University.
