# About Me
I am a second-year graduate student in the [Astronomy Department](https://www.astro.caltech.edu) at Caltech working with [Shri Kulkarni](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/), [Tom Prince](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~prince/), and [Lynne Hillenbrand](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~lah/Site/%40Caltech.html) on a variety of problems in stellar astronomy. Most recently, I've been working on cataclysmic variable stars discovered by the [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu).

I'm originally from the town (small city) of Salinas, California -- be sure to check out the [Salinas Observatory](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Community/Salinas-Observatory-103836256351138/) if you're in the area! I then completed my undergraduate education in the [Physics Department](https://physics.stanford.edu) at Stanford, where I participated in a number of student groups and ensembles, most notably the [Stanford Astronomical Society](https://orion.stanford.edu). While at Stanford, I conducted research in high-energy astrophysics, cosmology, and the astrophysics of young stars.
